This is an upload of a project I made while studying at University.

It's primary purpose is to act as a hub for a visual display (a connected LED Matrix) which will gather information from the connected social media APIs.

The program is currently set to display Twitter followers, YouTube subscribers, Weather via location and 24hr changes of the top 5 cryptocurrencies on CoinMarketCap.
