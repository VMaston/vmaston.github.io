1.  **Create a Subdomain or Use an Existing Domain**
	
    * *CPanel Menu -> Subdomains*
	
    After creating a subdomain, a directory is autogenerated in your CPanel filesystem in the format of _subdomain.domain.tld_. This is the folder we will be putting our website files into.

2.  **Issue SSL Certification (if newly created domain)**

	* *CPanel Menu -> Let’s Encrypt SSL -> Issue a new certificate -> + Issue*

    CPanel doesn't assign SSL certification by default for newly created subdomains. By using the Let's Encrypt tool provided by CPanel, you can generate a free SSL certificate for your subdomain - letting users access your content under a HTTPS url.

3.  **Compile Website Files**
	
    * *Terminal -> run ‘ng build’ command inside root of project directory.*

    Angular compiles your project to a folder called ‘dist’ which is generated within the project directory. These are the compiled files we will be using to populate your subdomain directory.

4.  **Upload contents of local ‘dist/\[your-app]’ directory to the root of the CPanel Filesystem subdomain directory generated in step 1.**

    * *CPanel Menu -> File Manager -> [your subdomain] files directory -> Upload*

    For compiled projects which make use of nested directories (folders within folders), I recommend using a tool like [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php) or transferring via SSH, as the default File Manager provided in the CPanel web interface doesn't handle files within nested folders.

5.  **Setup Request Redirects by editing the ‘.htaccess’ file located in the folder generated by subdomain creation in Step 1.**

    * *CPanel Menu -> File Manager -> [your subdomain] files directory -> ‘.htacess’ file -> Edit*

    ![.htaccess file](/assets/img/blog/hosting-an-angular-app-on-cpanel-2.png)

    Add this code block:

    ```
        RewriteEngine On
        
        RewriteBase /
        
        RewriteRule ^index\.html$ - [L]
        
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
        
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
        
        RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
    ```

    This will rewrite all requests from the registered domain’s navigation to the specific components of our angular application, and all non-file routes back to index.html.

**You should now be able to navigate to the URL registered to this angular application.**
