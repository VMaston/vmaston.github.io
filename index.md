### About Me

I am a Software Developer based in the United Kingdom.

Following my 2021 graduation from Aberystwyth University with a Computer Science degree, I have pursued a career as a Software Engineer. I have experience within the FinTech industry, bridging customer-facing products with accounting packages on a cloud ecosystem.

I am seeking opportunities to develop my skills and career in software development.

### Experience

    <div class="blogentry">
        <div class="title">Junior Developer @ Accountabl</div>
        <span class="postDate">February 2022 - June 2022</span>
        <span class="blurb">I was hired by Accountabl to accomplish their ambitions of a full ground-up redesign of the product and service, as the organization expanded it's goals from accounting to carbon tracking. My primary focus was on integrating several cloud accounting packages such as Xero and Sage into our software ecosystem, using a NestJS microservice I built from the ground up to handle any API calls required for our import/export procedures to these services.</span>

</div>

I design aesthetic and functional web application front-ends using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with a number of other frameworks such as Angular or Jekyll to provide a complex logic layer.

This skill in front-end development is paired with my experience in building reliable and scalable server-side applications using Node.js based frameworks, such as NestJS, while utilizing database technologies like MySQL to contain and manipulate complex datasets.

With a keen eye for the user experience and the server-side knowledge to support those experiences. I can create comprehensive web software with an intricate understanding of how these systems work at every level of abstraction.

Along with my primary development skills, I am also competent in using Git, work with Linux often & have past experience with developing software for IoT devices.
