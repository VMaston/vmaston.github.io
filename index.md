### About Me

I am a Software Developer based in the United Kingdom.

Following my 2021 graduation from Aberystwyth University with a Computer Science degree, I have pursued a career as a Software Engineer. I have experience within the FinTech industry, bridging customer-facing products with accounting packages on a cloud ecosystem.

I am seeking opportunities to develop my skills and career in software development.

### Experience

    <div class="blogentry">
        <div class="title">Junior Developer @ Accountabl</div>
        <span class="postDate">February 2022 - June 2022</span>
        <span class="blurb">I was hired by Accountabl to accomplish their ambitions of a full ground-up redesign of the product and service, as the organization expanded it's goals from commerce accounting to transaction-level carbon tracking. My primary focus was on integrating several cloud accounting packages such as Xero and Sage into our software ecosystem, using a NestJS microservice I built from the ground up to handle any API calls required for our import/export procedures to these services for our connected customers.</span>

Utilizing my prior experience in the FinTech ecosystem and API development for financial services, I have a focus on creating comprehensive, scalable and developer-friendly APIs.

I like to push the envelope and experiment with new front-end frameworks to explore what is possible for developers. I have built applications both in Remix (a React framework) and Svelte, and have past experience in Angular.

As a lifelong learner, I like to expand my knowledge into areas that interest me. Currently, I am focusing on Golang to further my knowledge of backend architechtures outside of the Node ecosystem, and keeping up with the embedded hobbyist culture with C++.

Along with my primary development skills, I am also competent in using Git, work with Linux & have past experience with developing software for IoT devices.
